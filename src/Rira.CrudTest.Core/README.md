# Core (Domain) Project

## Overview
The Core project contains the domain models, entities, and business logic. It is the central part of the application, independent of external frameworks or libraries.

## Contents
- **Entities**: Define the core business objects.

## Key Concepts
- **Separation of Concerns**: Core is framework-agnostic and only contains domain logic.
- **Clean Architecture**: Core serves as the foundation for other layers.
